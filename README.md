# Weather App

## Description

This app displays the current weather of a city and a five day forecast as well. The app uses the Open Weather API to display data and allows the user to store cities in local storage. The motivation behind the project is to learn how server-side APIs can be implemented in applications and to continue to learn how to utilize HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript as well. This project solves the problem of figuring out the weather in certain cities and I learned how to use APIs to implement data in applications.
